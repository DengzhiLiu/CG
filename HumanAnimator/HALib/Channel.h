* Each joint holds information like:
*		name
*		parent's name
*		all its children's name
*		rotation order
*		lenght of joint (this is the offset)
*		channel names (rotateX, rotateY, rotateZ, translateX, ......)
*		frame data for those channels (these are the euler angles)
*		quaternion data for each channel
*		marker data at every frame for original, euler and quaternions
*
* Any time you are required to give the values frameNum to a function in this class
* you will think of 1 as the first frame and you can go to <= total number of frames
